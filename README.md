# A Unified Remote Sensing Object Detector Based on Fourier Contour Parametric Learning


## Updates

 - (June, 2020) April 25, 2024: This repository is constructed and the related DATASET would be released soon.
 - (April, 2020) We released a state-of-the-art (multi-category-/ pose-/ 3d-) tracking extension [CenterTrack](https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterTrack).

## Abstract 



## Highlights

- **Simple:** One-stage and Anchor-free

- **Versatile:** The same framework works for object detection, 3d bounding box estimation, and multi-person pose estimation with minor modification.

- **Fast:** The whole process in a single network feedforward. No NMS post processing is needed. Our DLA-34 model runs at *52* FPS with *37.4* COCO AP.

- **Strong**: Our best single model achieves *45.1*AP on COCO test-dev.

- **Easy to use:** We provide user friendly testing API and webcam demos.
